# Right now It's all work in progress. 
# ReadOnlyBlog

I wanted to create fast and very simple CMS for read only purposes. It is made so I can get rid of wordpress for my "Projects" subdomain that is holding posts containing some text images and links. The website is just showcase of my projects and some thoughts. I don't need users or comments and any of fancy features of wordpress, that I stripped of anyway. I don't want to use overcomplicated edited by me striped down solution for this basic needs. That's why I want to create easy website that let's it's user create posts containing images and other important stuff. I want to create solution from the ground including insulation script. I do not use anything already made aside from Bootstrap for frontend. I opted out of using JavaScript for now, and there will be 2 version of the project. One of them (that I'm going to use) will not contain ANY ADDITIONAL JavaScript other than that provided by Bootstrap.  I want it to be simple and I'm using "KISS" principal.

# Why 2 versions?

As JavaScript creator said: ~"It has so many congenital defects it really is a smelly language." - https://youtu.be/lc5Np9OqDHU?t=21 | if the video goes down by some reason - tell me I will reupload :) |
Everyone knows jokes about quirks and different inconsistencies in the language. Tho's I treat unnecessary JavaScript as bloat.(in fact I treat whole JavaScript as bloat in some instances) Additionaly I don't think that every webpage and solution needs to sugarcoat the user and use eye candy and AJAX to not reload page. So the base version of the web system I'm trying to produce will be free of any JavaScript written by me. I will make fork/version that does use AJAX and other fancy things, but I recommend using simpler version. In the end booth will achieve the same goal, and the JS'Less version will be faster and safer. It allows you to disable JavaScript in browser and still have 100% functionality of the website.

# This readme is subjected to change
I'm planing to release the website as free for private use and modification. I will create and maintain documentation after I make major working version line idk~ 0.5? Right now It's all work in progress. I'm sure I will tell you more about why I decided to create this project and how it will go in the future!
